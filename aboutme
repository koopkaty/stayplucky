<h1>I created this site not only as a portfolio and showcase all of those things,</h1>
<p>but as a real honest to goodness blog, which is a portfolio in itself for getting writing gigs.That&rsquo;s all true. It&rsquo;s not rocket science that if you have a body of work recorded on a website, it&rsquo;s good for your personal brand.Yep, yep and yep&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.4;">💩</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">💩</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">💩</span></p>
<h1>and as a means to stay plucky&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.4;">💁</span></h1>
<p>In between writing, acting, or other artistic gigs, it gets easy to feel very lost. Sure you feel great at first because you finally have some time to breathe and think&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>and then you have time to breathe and think&nbsp;</strong><span style="line-height: 1.4;">😐</span></p>
<p>The search for the next gig, the next project becomes a steady stream of boxed wine, netflix, and fast food tacos, that all start to make me feel like a terrible slob pile that doesn&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s doing with her life. Thoughts like &lsquo;oh god what am I going to do?&rsquo;, &lsquo;of course you deserve this you dumb slut, you went to a private liberal arts school and got degrees in English and Theatre of all things and then couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to take the damn GRE&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Maybe I should just go back to school and become a night-baker&rsquo; come up. Then, lo and behold, all of by constant craigslisting and job hunting pays off and I get my next gig but not after a lot of psychic stress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, to prevent that, this gives me a constant project, but something to develop and work on and help me record my process and help me stay sane.</p>
<p>and if I can help you stay sane too, climb aboard the plucky train- we&rsquo;re gonna have a time&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.4;">🚂</span></p>
